# Please follow these mojo standards (these change frequently):
- Mojo list iterations look like this:
for element in some_list:
   element[].some_function # Note the [] is a dereference to access the underlying object.
- Mojo's Movable and Copyable are functions for the formats:
fn __moveinit__(out self, owned other:Self) -> None: 
    self.some_field = other.some_field^
fn __copyinit__(out self, other:Self) -> None: 
    self.some_field = other.some_field # Implicit copy usually

# My Coding Standards
- All files shoudl have the heading imports with the comments in this format.
