description: When creating a new mojo_ast_node type node, here are a few things you need to do
globs: *.mojo
alwaysApply: false

# Please follow these mojo standards (these change frequently):
- Impliment everything in c_binder.ast.traits.mojo: AstNodeLike
- Add the new node to c_binder.ast.__init__.mojo: As an import and add to the variant.
   - In the past you tend to remove nodes from the init for now reason. Don't remove any nodes unless you have good reason to.
- Use [example_node.mojo](mdc:c_binder_mojo/ast/example_node.mojo) on how to make a basic node. It also has useful comments
and notes on the direction this API is moving.
- You can test anything via pixi run test_some_test_name. Look in the pixi.toml for how. This command is available from the shell
so you dont need to adjust any pathing.
- Use `pixi run test_all` for sanity and compilation checks.
Reference [how-to-code-in-mojo.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/how-to-code-in-mojo.mdc) for extra details.
