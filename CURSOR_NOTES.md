HUGE MILESTONE! üéâ We have tests/integration/test_mujoco/output/test_mjmodel.mojo fully generated and compilable.

## Current Status - Reality Check
- ‚úÖ C AST parsing and analysis working
- ‚úÖ Mojo AST generation working  
- ‚úÖ Type mapping system in place
- ‚úÖ Full MuJoCo bindings generated and compilable
- ‚úÖ **Basic dl binding works** - we have auto-generation code for this
- ‚úÖ **AST parsing improvements** - better handling of TypedefDecl, FunctionDecl, and other node types
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Hitting limits**: Grammar objects are nice but we're pushing them to their breaking point
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Edge case explosion**: Loads of edge cases surfacing at this point
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Boilerplate explosion**: NodeAstLike implementations have significant repetitive code

## Major Pain Points
1. **Record handling is rough** - need much better approach
2. **Forward declarations** - handling is problematic 
3. **Nested if statement logic** - getting unwieldy and hard to maintain
4. **Code correctness** - need cleanup and validation
5. **Boilerplate code** - NodeAstLike trait implementations have lots of repetitive getter methods

## Recent Progress & Insights
- **AST Token Parsing**: Improved understanding of how Clang represents typedefs, function declarations, etc.
- **Referenced vs Defined**: Better handling of `referenced` vs `implicit` vs defined typedefs
- **Quote Handling**: Fixed issues with single vs double quotes in AST token parsing
- **Boilerplate Reduction**: Identified several approaches to reduce repetitive code in node implementations

## Roadmap - Code Quality & Robustness
**Focus on fundamentals before expanding:**

1. **Code cleanup and correctness**:
   - Refactor nested if statement logic
   - Improve maintainability and readability
   - Add proper error handling and validation

2. **Fix record handling**:
   - Better strategy for parsing and representing C structs/unions
   - Handle complex nested structures properly
   - Improve forward declaration resolution

3. **Architecture improvements**:
   - Grammar objects are at their limit - consider redesign
   - Better separation of concerns
   - More robust edge case handling

4. **Boilerplate reduction** (NEW PRIORITY):
   - Implement base node struct with common fields
   - Create DefaultNodeImpl mixin trait for common NodeAstLike methods
   - Reduce repetitive getter implementations across all node types
   - Consider composition-based approach for node implementations

## Technical Debt to Address
- **CRITICAL**: Refactor the nested if statement mess
- **CRITICAL**: Improve record/struct handling architecture  
- **CRITICAL**: Better forward declaration resolution
- **HIGH**: Reduce boilerplate in NodeAstLike implementations
- Look into figuring out what to do with `Grammar` objects. They are nice, but very adhoc.
- Probably just create the missing nodes that we are currently just leaving as ast entries.
- Beef up the type mapper (more comprehensive type coverage)
- Type mapper should track what it needs to import
- Add validation that our generated Mojo types actually work with FFI

## Boilerplate Reduction Approaches Explored
1. **Base Node Struct**: Common fields and methods shared across nodes
2. **Default Implementation Mixin**: Trait providing default NodeAstLike implementations
3. **Composition-based Nodes**: Nodes compose with base struct instead of inheriting
4. **Template-based Generation**: Parameter functions for generating common methods
5. **Macro-like Parameter Functions**: Compile-time generation of boilerplate

## Philosophy
We're at a crossroads - lots of edge cases means we need to step back and improve the foundation before pushing forward. Quality over quantity at this stage. The boilerplate reduction work will make the codebase much more maintainable and reduce the cognitive load when adding new node types.

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Complete mapping and supporting all nodes produced by Clang.
