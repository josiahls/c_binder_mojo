HUGE MILESTONE! üéâ We have tests/integration/test_mujoco/output/test_mjmodel.mojo fully generated and compilable.

## Current Status - Reality Check
- ‚úÖ C AST parsing and analysis working
- ‚úÖ Mojo AST generation working  
- ‚úÖ Type mapping system in place
- ‚úÖ Full MuJoCo bindings generated and compilable
- ‚úÖ **Basic dl binding works** - we have auto-generation code for this
- ‚úÖ **AST parsing improvements** - better handling of TypedefDecl, FunctionDecl, and other node types
- ‚úÖ **Grammar object migration** - moving away from grammar objects to direct node metadata stripping
- ‚úÖ **Composable node architecture** - creating nodes for EVERY AST node in Clang output
- ‚úÖ **Improved quote handling** - cleaner parsing of quoted sections (sugar, types, etc.)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Edge case explosion**: Loads of edge cases surfacing at this point
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Boilerplate explosion**: NodeAstLike implementations have significant repetitive code

## Major Pain Points
1. **Record handling is rough** - need much better approach
2. **Forward declarations** - handling is problematic 
3. **Nested if statement logic** - getting unwieldy and hard to maintain
4. **Code correctness** - need cleanup and validation
5. **Boilerplate code** - NodeAstLike trait implementations have lots of repetitive getter methods

## Current Next Steps (IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES)

### MuJoCo Bindings Issues Found
1. **Blank alias issue**: `alias mjtDisableBit = ` is blank - TypedefDeclNode not properly extracting type name
2. **AlignedAttr support missing**: Need to handle `AlignedAttr` nodes for field alignment (e.g., `aligned Int = 8`)
3. **Enum value auto-assignment**: Enum constants without explicit values need automatic incrementing values
4. **Struct syntax errors**: Multiple enum structs have malformed syntax causing linter errors

## Recent Progress & Insights
- **AST Token Parsing**: Improved understanding of how Clang represents typedefs, function declarations, etc.
- **Referenced vs Defined**: Better handling of `referenced` vs `implicit` vs defined typedefs
- **Quote Handling**: Fixed issues with single vs double quotes in AST token parsing
- **Grammar Object Migration**: Successfully moved away from grammar objects to direct node metadata stripping
- **Composable Architecture**: Creating nodes for every AST node type keeps the system composable and extensible
- **Boilerplate Reduction**: Identified several approaches to reduce repetitive code in node implementations

## Roadmap - Code Quality & Robustness
**Focus on fundamentals before expanding:**

1. **Code cleanup and correctness**:
   - Refactor nested if statement logic
   - Improve maintainability and readability
   - Add proper error handling and validation

2. **Fix record handling**:
   - Better strategy for parsing and representing C structs/unions
   - Handle complex nested structures properly
   - Improve forward declaration resolution

3. **Architecture improvements**:
   - Grammar object migration completed - focus on node completeness
   - Better separation of concerns
   - More robust edge case handling

4. **Boilerplate reduction**:
   - Implement base node struct with common fields
   - Create DefaultNodeImpl mixin trait for common NodeAstLike methods
   - Reduce repetitive getter implementations across all node types
   - Consider composition-based approach for node implementations

## Boilerplate Reduction Approaches Explored
1. **Base Node Struct**: Common fields and methods shared across nodes
2. **Default Implementation Mixin**: Trait providing default NodeAstLike implementations
3. **Composition-based Nodes**: Nodes compose with base struct instead of inheriting
4. **Template-based Generation**: Parameter functions for generating common methods
5. **Macro-like Parameter Functions**: Compile-time generation of boilerplate

## Philosophy
We're at a crossroads - lots of edge cases means we need to step back and improve the foundation before pushing forward. Quality over quantity at this stage. The boilerplate reduction work will make the codebase much more maintainable and reduce the cognitive load when adding new node types.
