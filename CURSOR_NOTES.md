HUGE MILESTONE! üéâ We have tests/integration/test_mujoco/output/test_mjmodel.mojo fully generated and compilable.

## Current Status - Reality Check
- ‚úÖ C AST parsing and analysis working
- ‚úÖ Mojo AST generation working  
- ‚úÖ Type mapping system in place
- ‚úÖ Full MuJoCo bindings generated and compilable
- ‚úÖ **Basic dl binding works** - we have auto-generation code for this
- ‚úÖ **AST parsing improvements** - better handling of TypedefDecl, FunctionDecl, and other node types
- ‚úÖ **Grammar object migration** - moving away from grammar objects to direct node metadata stripping
- ‚úÖ **Composable node architecture** - creating nodes for EVERY AST node in Clang output
- ‚úÖ **Improved quote handling** - cleaner parsing of quoted sections (sugar, types, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Enum value auto assignement** - auto assignement of enum values
- ‚úÖ **A million little bug fixes** - we are getting close to a working binding. It appears we have reached the final bug.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Edge case explosion**: Loads of edge cases surfacing at this point
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Boilerplate explosion**: NodeAstLike implementations have significant repetitive code

## Major Pain Points
1. **Record handling is rough** - need much better approach
2. **Forward declarations** - handling is problematic 
3. **Nested if statement logic** - getting unwieldy and hard to maintain
4. **Code correctness** - need cleanup and validation
5. **Boilerplate code** - NodeAstLike trait implementations have lots of repetitive getter methods

## Immediate previous progress
- Mujoco similation works for the first time. Need to do additional testing. Ideally save mujoco camera outputs to a video.
