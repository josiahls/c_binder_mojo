HUGE MILESTONE! üéâ We have tests/integration/test_mujoco/output/test_mjmodel.mojo fully generated and compilable.

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ C AST parsing and analysis working
- ‚úÖ Mojo AST generation working  
- ‚úÖ Type mapping system in place
- ‚úÖ Full MuJoCo bindings generated and compilable
- ‚ùì **CRITICAL UNKNOWN**: Do the bindings actually work as FFI?

## Next Critical Steps - FFI Validation
**We need to validate the absolute basics work before proceeding:**

1. **Micro-test FFI fundamentals**:
   - Does `Int` in Mojo actually convert to `int` in C and back?
   - Does `Float32` in Mojo convert to `float` in C and back?
   - Do basic pointer types work?
   - Can we call a simple C function and get the expected result?

2. **Create minimal test cases**:
   - Single function with simple int parameter and return
   - Single function with float parameter and return  
   - Single function with pointer parameter
   - Verify round-trip type conversions

3. **Before expanding scope**:
   - Validate TypeMapper conversions are correct in practice
   - Ensure our generated FFI signatures match what Mojo expects
   - Test with actual C library calls, not just compilation

## Technical Debt to Address
- Beef up the type mapper (more comprehensive type coverage)
- Type mapper should track what it needs to import
- Add validation that our generated Mojo types actually work with FFI

## Philosophy
Take this EXTREMELY incrementally. One working FFI call is worth more than 1000 compilable but broken bindings.
