HUGE MILESTONE! üéâ We have tests/integration/test_mujoco/output/test_mjmodel.mojo fully generated and compilable.

## Current Status - Reality Check
- ‚úÖ C AST parsing and analysis working
- ‚úÖ Mojo AST generation working  
- ‚úÖ Type mapping system in place
- ‚úÖ Full MuJoCo bindings generated and compilable
- ‚úÖ **Basic dl binding works** - we have auto-generation code for this
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Hitting limits**: Grammar objects are nice but we're pushing them to their breaking point
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Edge case explosion**: Loads of edge cases surfacing at this point

## Major Pain Points
1. **Record handling is rough** - need much better approach
2. **Forward declarations** - handling is problematic 
3. **Nested if statement logic** - getting unwieldy and hard to maintain
4. **Code correctness** - need cleanup and validation

## Next Critical Steps - Code Quality & Robustness
**Focus on fundamentals before expanding:**

1. **Code cleanup and correctness**:
   - Refactor nested if statement logic
   - Improve maintainability and readability
   - Add proper error handling and validation

2. **Fix record handling**:
   - Better strategy for parsing and representing C structs/unions
   - Handle complex nested structures properly
   - Improve forward declaration resolution

3. **Architecture improvements**:
   - Grammar objects are at their limit - consider redesign
   - Better separation of concerns
   - More robust edge case handling

## Technical Debt to Address
- **CRITICAL**: Refactor the nested if statement mess
- **CRITICAL**: Improve record/struct handling architecture  
- **CRITICAL**: Better forward declaration resolution
- Beef up the type mapper (more comprehensive type coverage)
- Type mapper should track what it needs to import
- Add validation that our generated Mojo types actually work with FFI

## Philosophy
We're at a crossroads - lots of edge cases means we need to step back and improve the foundation before pushing forward. Quality over quantity at this stage.
